--The first five optimizations of parameterized prepared statements always rely on
--the actual parameter values; the planner calculates the average cost of custom
--plans based on these values. Starting from the sixth execution, if the generic plan
--turns out to be more efficient than custom plans on average (taking into account
--that custom plans have to be built anew every time), the planner keeps the generic
--plan and continues using it, skipping the optimization stage.

--However,v. if the planner makes a mistake, you can override the automatic decision
--auto and select either the generic or a custom plan by setting the plan_cache_mode parameter accordingly:
-- => SET plan_cache_mode = 'force_custom_plan';

--Among other things, the pg_prepared_statements viewv. shows statistics on chosen plans:
-- => SELECT name, generic_plans, custom_plans FROM pg_prepared_statements;
